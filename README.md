# Welcome to www.mohanadarafe.io

After collecting knowledge in web programming. I decided to build a personal/portfolio website to show multiple things. First, my front-end & back-end skills & second, my other projects. **No templates used.**

## Front-end

Using HTML & CSS in a plain text editor, I stacked up all my past projects and threw them on there. As for external resources & stylesheets, I used a bootstrap to customize a web-responsive menu, CSS Animate & WOW.

## Back-end

In order to get things up and running. I started by adding a smooth scrolling aspect to the website to give it a modern look. This was done with an external jQuery smooth scrolling code. Finally, the **Contact Us** mechanism works with phpMailer.
